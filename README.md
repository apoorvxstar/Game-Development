This repository is a compendium of my game making journey. It will serve the purpose of recording my ideas of story and entertainment, original concepts of technical and artistic nature, assets and art that I create, and game prototypes that I build. Hope that anyone who stumbles upon it can appreciate my creations and observe my growth as I go on to make transcendental games one day!
